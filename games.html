                        <td><b>Chivalry 2</b> is an action game played from either first-person or third-person perspective, either on foot or on horseback for the first time in the series. In the game, players are equipped with various medieval melee weapons such as war hammers, maces, flails, long swords and battle axes, though they can also use bows and arrows. New weapons can be found in weapon caches in a map. Players have three basic melee attack patterns: horizontal slash, vertical slash, and a stab, which can be chained together. Players also need to block hostile attacks, and with the right timing, they can stagger their opponents and parry their attacks. Players must be aware of how they swing their weapons, as friendly fire may occur following an unplanned strike.</td>
