                <p>Originally starting on YouTube and having streamed on Twitch.TV since around 2018, Jax has strove hard to build up an awesome community of people that not only have helped him much in the past but also have helped each other. Whether it be story based games, multiplayer based games, shooters, family friendly story games, indie games, or just silly little art things, here he tries to offer a bit of something for everyone with interactions for all.</p><br>
                <p>He's even made all his own emotes, intro and outro videos, and even overlays. Impressive, right?</p><br>
                <p>So whether your preferance is interactions or just lurking for a quiet time, you may find something you like here. So what do you say?</p><br>
